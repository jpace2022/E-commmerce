## Discription

- Given a functional Express.js API when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file.
- Then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize when I enter schema and seed commands.
- Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data when I enter the command to invoke the application.
- Then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database when I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags.
- Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON when I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
- Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## Mock Up
   Fill out the unfinished routes in `product-routes.js`, `tag-routes.js`, and `category-routes.js` to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.

Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.

> **Hint**: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what `req.body` will be for POST and PUT routes!
